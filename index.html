		SiK is a simple and easy to use tool! <br>
		Press ‘Send Location’ or ‘Find Friends’ button, the former one allows user to share their location to their friends, the latter one allows user to get the location of their friends based on their UID (User Identifier). The UID is a six-digit number to recognize users. If user typed in the UID, an embedded google map will show the location of the user correspond to that UID. If user needs to find that user, simply press ‘Go and Find’ button, then web page will be directed to Google Map to guide user to destination.
